<p>Gary, now I know I was wrong</p>
<p>I messed up, and now you're gone</p>
<p>Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you</p>
<p>Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me</p>
<p>Feeling this empty</p>
<p>Your meow right now would sound like music to me</p>
<p>Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>(Gary, come home)</p>
<p>Gary, can't you see I was blind?</p>
<p>I'll do anything to change your mind</p>
<p>More than a pet, you're my best friend</p>
<p>Too cool to forget</p>
<p>Come back 'cause we are family</p>
<p>And forgive me for making you wanna roam</p>
<p>And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome</p>
<p>Somewhere I hope you're reading</p>
<p>My latest three-word poem</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>(Gary, come home)</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>(Gary, come home)</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>(Gary, come home), ah</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>Gary, come home</p>
<p>Gary, won't you come home?</p>
