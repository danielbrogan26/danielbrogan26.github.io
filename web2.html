<p>Gary, now I know I was wrong
I messed up, and now you're gone
Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you
Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me
Feeling this empty
Your meow right now would sound like music to me
Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)
Gary, can't you see I was blind?
I'll do anything to change your mind
More than a pet, you're my best friend
Too cool to forget
Come back 'cause we are family
And forgive me for making you wanna roam
And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome
Somewhere I hope you're reading
My latest three-word poem
Gary, come home
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home), ah
Gary, come home
Gary, come home
Gary, won't you come home?</p>
